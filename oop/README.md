Activity: Working with Arrays in Java
Learning Objectives:

👉To understand how to declare, initialize, and access arrays.

👉To practice traversing arrays using for, for-each, and while loops.

👉To apply arrays in solving simple problems.

Instructions:

1. Open your Java IDE or text editor.
2. Create a new Java file named ArrayActivity.java.
3. Follow the tasks below.

Lets do it!!!
💻Activity 1: Declare and Initialize an Array

Create an integer array named 𝓼𝓬𝓸𝓻𝓮 with the values: 72, 85, 90, 78, 99, 92, 88, 75, 82, 74.

Print the first, lowest, highest and last elements of the array.

💻Activity 2: Traverse the Array

Use a for loop to print all the elements of the scores array with their index.

Then use a for-each loop to print only the values.

💻Activity 3: Calculate the Average

Using the scores array, calculate the average score.

Print the result.

📖 Discussion Questions

1. What is the difference between a for loop and a for-each loop in array traversal?

2. Why do we use scores.length instead of a fixed number in the loop condition?

3. What will happen if you try to access scores[11] in this example.

Write your answer in a yellow paper.
